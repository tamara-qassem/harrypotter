Have you ever laid awake at night, pondering the pressing question of which Harry Potter character has the most lines? No? Just me? Well, in the pursuit of answering life's most crucial inquiries, I embarked on this daring journey. My hypothesis: it's probably Harry Potter himself. Riveting, I know.
