# Harry Potter Data Analysis

## Overview 
So, you know how everyone has that guilty pleasure, that one thing they're secretly obsessed with? Well, mine happens to be the magical world of Harry Potter. And what do you do when you love something? You create a project around it because clearly, that's the most logical thing to do. In a stroke of genius (or madness), I found a way to combine my passion for data and Harry Potter. Accio data analysis!

Have you ever laid awake at night, pondering the pressing question of which Harry Potter character has the most lines? No? Just me? Well, in the pursuit of answering life's most crucial inquiries, I embarked on this daring journey. My hypothesis: it's probably Harry Potter himself. Riveting, I know.

Sure, there are plenty of data analysis projects out there, but how many of them let you dive into the magical world of wizards and witches? Behold, the Harry Potter Data Analysis project! But wait, there's more! I didn't just stop at boring charts and graphs; I spiced it up with Streamlit. Yes, you heard it rightâ€”interactivity that even Professor Snape would crack a smile at. Dive in, play with the data, and discover the magic of analytics (not actual magic, unfortunately).

## Project Details
I obtained the datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gulsahdemiryurek/harry-potter-dataset/data). All datasets are conveniently located in the "datasets" folder for easy access.

### Data Processing
1. **Data Exploration:** I delved into the datasets to understand the magical world of Harry Potter better.
2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Armed with my trusty wand (and pandas), I cleaned and transformed the data to reveal its true potential.

### Analysis Techniques
- **NLP (Natural Language Processing):** Unveiling the secrets hidden in the script texts using NLP techniques.

### Data Visualization
For the grand reveal, I used a combination of libraries:
- **plotly.graph_objects**
- **plotly.express**

Why? Because static graphs are so Muggle-ish. With these libraries, the visualizations come to life, giving an interactive and enchanting feel to the results.

## How to Use
Replicating my project is quite simple. Follow these steps:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all the libraries necessary for the project. 

Then, run the following command:

```bash
streamlit run harry_potter.py
```
And voila! Your Harry Potter Data Analysis project is ready!
